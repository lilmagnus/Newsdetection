"The document is dated January 9, 2023 and is a response to a public consultation regarding a detailed regulation plan for Kr\u00e6mer Brygge northeast in Troms\u00f8 Municipality. The plan aims to create a more urban and varied building structure in accordance with the district's development plan and approved housing applications. The State Road Administration's role in the planning process is to ensure that national and regional transportation guidelines are followed, and while they have some comments on the proposal, they do not oppose it overall.This document dated 18.11.2020 is from the Sametinget regarding the start of a detailed regulation plan in Troms\u00f8. They state that the planned project does not conflict with protected Sami cultural heritage but advise immediate notification if any artifacts are found during construction. The document is also copied to Asplan Viak AS and Troms og Finnmark fylkeskommune.The email is a follow-up regarding the remaining plan documents for Kr\u00e6mer, including updated regulations, descriptions, and analyses. The decision to divide the new common areas near the east quay into three sections is to clarify responsibility and authority for each area, allowing for tailored use of the outdoor spaces for each building. The sender requests confirmation that all necessary documents have been received and inquires about the progress of the matter.The document is dated 7th June 2023 and discusses a geotechnical assessment for the development of residential blocks Alfon D, E, and F by Kr\u00e6mer Eiendom AS. The plan has been subject to public consultation with comments from the NVE. The document addresses concerns about the presence of sensitive material and historical ground movements in the area.\n\nThe document dated 711607-RIG-NOT-015 discusses two ground ruptures caused by local rotation landslides on a property. Despite the classification of the material as brittle fracture material, the ruptures did not exhibit typical brittle fracture behavior. It is recommended not to establish a danger zone in the area, but to implement extended control of geotechnical design and construction in accordance with NVE's recommendations.\n\nKr\u00e6mer Eiendom has started detailed planning for Alfan DEF, which has been subjected to public consultation. NVE has requested Multiconsult to confirm that the location and properties of the brittle material make it unnecessary to define and investigate a quick clay zone in accordance with NVE 1/2019 in connection with the regulatory plan. The ground conditions in the area consist of brittle material in some areas, but historical ground failures have been localized and can be attributed to deviations from geotechnical procedures, leading to a recommendation for extended geotechnical monitoring rather than establishing a hazard zone.\n\nDet anbefales at kvalitetssikring av notatet utf\u00f8res av en uavhengig foretak iht krav for tiltakskategori K4. NVE mener at uavhengig kvalitetssikring ikke er n\u00f8dvendig da spr\u00f8bruddmaterialet i sj\u00f8en ikke ber\u00f8rer et stort omr\u00e5de p\u00e5 land.
