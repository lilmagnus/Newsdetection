"The document is dated March 24, 2023, and is a response from Statsforvalteren regarding a complaint about the approval of a construction project at a specific address in Kristiansand kommune. The owners of the property had applied for a permit, which was initially granted by the municipality but overturned by Statsforvalteren due to lack of proper dispensation. The owners subsequently reapplied for a permit for the construction project, including a fence and a garden room, and are awaiting a decision.\n\nThe application referred to an outdated utilization rate compared to newer areas with higher building density, with approval from the engineering department and stated that the construction was of small scale and would not impact traffic. The municipality approved the application for exemption and building permit on 25.09.19, which was then appealed by the owners of a neighboring property on 21.10.19, with the appeal subsequently being forwarded to the State Administration for a final decision. The State Administration's assessment included considerations of the submission of the complaint within the deadline, and they have the authority to make a new decision or refer the case back for further consideration.\n\nThe document, dated before 22.06.2011, states that the construction of a garden room with a partition wall is subject to a permit application due to non-compliance with current zoning regulations. The authorities must ensure that the proposed construction does not violate any provisions of the planning and building law. The property is part of the Hellemyr area's zoning plan from 11.10.1973, which requires a detailed development plan for the specific area where the property is located.\n\nThere is a document dated September 25, 2019 discussing a dispensation request for the placement and size of a building in Kristiansand. The document discusses issues related to building regulations, specific placements, and the importance of adhering to existing plans. Ultimately, the decision by the Statsforvalteren was to not grant dispensation for the building's placement and size, overturning Kristiansand municipality's previous decision, based on the potential impact on neighboring properties and the overall area."
