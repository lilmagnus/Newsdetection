"The document is an application for permission for a building project, mentioning various requirements such as adherence to building laws and regulations. The document appears to be dated March 19, 2020 and includes details about the project location, type, and necessary attachments. The responsible applicant is AT Plan og Arkitektur AS with contact person Daniel Woll.The document, dated April 3, 2023, from Troms og Finnmark fylkeskommune, acknowledges receipt of a neighbor notification for a temporary use permit for Workinntunet hotel in Troms\u00f8 kommune, as well as a request for a dispensation from the regulations of zoning plan no. 1788. The fylkeskommune notes that the application must first be processed by Troms\u00f8 kommune before being considered under road laws, and emphasizes the need for all necessary permits or statements from other authorities to be obtained before starting the project. Additionally, it reminds the developer Huldervegen 2 AS to remove leftover asphalt and gravel from the ditches on both sides of fylkesveg 862 promptly.This document is an application for a facade change on a approved hotel building located at Huldervegen 2 in Troms\u00f8. The application is submitted by Huldervegen 2 AS with AT Arkitektur AS as the responsible applicant. The date of the document is April 20, 2023.\n\nAT Arkitektur s\u00f8kte om rammetillatelse den 21.4.2020 for \u00e5 bygge et hotell p\u00e5 Huldervegen 2 i Troms\u00f8. I f\u00f8lgebrevet til s\u00f8knaden ble det redegjort for de visuelle kvalitetene til hotellbygget, med fokus p\u00e5 plassering, h\u00f8yde og design. Troms\u00f8 kommune ga rammetillatelse for oppf\u00f8ring av hotellet den 15.5.2020, og uttalte at bygningen har gode visuelle kvaliteter i forhold til seg selv, funksjonen og innenfor planens rammer.\n\nA hotel building with a maximum height of +44.0 meters and 11 floors is planned for construction on Huldervegen 2, based on a submission for a building permit dated April 21, 2020. The design of the hotel emphasizes visual qualities, with dynamic forms created by slanted and tilted outer walls. The building's vertical window bands and top-floor glass section contribute to its visually appealing design, which was approved by Troms\u00f8 municipality on May 15, 2020 in accordance with existing zoning regulations.\n\nThe hotel has good visual qualities according to the municipality in relation to itself, its function, and its built and natural surroundings. The property is designated for hotel accommodation with a maximum height of +44.0, with 11 floors that will appear differently depending on the viewpoint. The municipality did not specify requirements for material use and color selection, but Avinor's approval is needed for the final decision on the facade. The document is from AT Arkitektur, with organization number 986 676 813, based in Troms\u00f8.\n\nThe document, dated unspecified, discusses a proposed hotel building with a facade made of \"black concrete\" that will appear grey in daylight, especially towards sensitive areas. Several facade materials were considered to avoid reflections towards the airport and maintain quality, ultimately choosing polished concrete and vertical ridges to prevent negative reflections. Despite being called \"black concrete,\" the facade will appear grey during the day and almost black at night, with a color that may vary depending on lighting conditions.\n\nThe document, dated unknown, discusses the discrepancies between the color shades in an illustration submitted to the municipality and Avinor. The municipality did not specify requirements for materials and colors, but Avinor's approval was necessary for these aspects. Several facade materials were considered, with the final choice being polished concrete to avoid negative reflections towards the airport, ensuring both aesthetics and safety.\n\nA document from AT Arkitektur explains that the dark gray (\"black concrete\") material used in a building will withstand time and not be negatively affected by dirt and runoff from road dust. The material, though referred to as \"black concrete,\" will appear gray during the day and nearly black at night, depending on weather conditions. The building project has received various permits for different construction phases, but a letter from the municipality dated November 22, 2022, raises concerns about the facade not matching the approved design and requiring a new application.\n\nIn 2022, it was observed that the municipality based its assessment on the approved visual qualities of the building, including a gray facade and approved window bands with vertical displacements. AT Architecture believes that when the municipality concluded that the facades needed to be reapplied for in a letter dated 22.11.2022, they did not have all the information available. The municipality did not seem to consider the information provided in the Avinor application dated 6.3.2022, which detailed the material usage and showed a grayish facade in illustrations.\n\nI et brev datert 22.11.2022 har kommunen p\u00e5pekt at den p\u00e5g\u00e5ende bygningen ikke samsvarer med den godkjente fasaden og mangler vertikale vindusb\u00e5nd. Tiltakshaveren mener endringene i vinduene er innenfor normal utvikling og ikke krever ny s\u00f8knad. Kommunen krever imidlertid at fasaden m\u00e5 s\u00f8kes p\u00e5 nytt i tr\u00e5d med den opprinnelige tillatelsen gitt i 2020.\n\nThe document, dated 2022, states that the municipality did not have all the information regarding the application to Avinor. The illustrations presented to both the municipality and Avinor show a grey facade, despite the material being described as \"black concrete\" in the application to Avinor. The building is still under construction, and details such as the vertical displacements in the window bands have not been finalized or installed yet.\n\nThe document from AT Arkitektur dated 16.3.2023 addresses minor adjustments to windows in a project, stating that they are within normal development and do not trigger a change application. However, the municipality has issued a notice to correct the facade and imposed a penalty due to changes in color and size of windows not aligning with approved plans. The architects have requested clarification from the municipality regarding the changes and provided an illustration of the facade as intended upon completion.\n\nI detaljprosjektet ble det funnet en bedre l\u00f8sning for solavskjerming, noe som f\u00f8rte til endringer i vindusformatene for \u00e5 opprettholde kravene til dagslysinnslipp nedfelt i TEK17 \u00a7 13-7. Bygningen ble vurdert til \u00e5 beholde sitt fasadeuttrykk selv med endringene i vindusst\u00f8rrelse, da det kun ble sett p\u00e5 som tilpasninger til tekniske krav. Kommunen varsler om p\u00e5legg om retting av fasaden og mulig tvangsmulkt, da endringer i farge og vindusst\u00f8rrelse ikke stemmer overens med godkjenningen fra rammes\u00f8knaden datert 16.3.2023.\n\nThe windows do not have vertical displacements as indicated in the approved drawings, with the changes being attributed to the need for a more practical solution for sun shading. The alterations to the window sizes were considered a minor adjustment to meet technical requirements, maintaining the overall facade expression. Despite the discrepancies between the approved window sizes and the actual changes made, the deviation falls within the allowable tolerance for height measurements according to the guidelines. (No specific date mentioned in the text)\n\nThe document, dated after 12.12.2022, discusses changes made to a building in Troms\u00f8, including the placement of new windows and adjustments to the western cornice. It addresses a potential issue regarding the color of the facade, clarifying that it complies with Avinor's approval. There is some confusion regarding whether the color shown in a sign application is being mistaken for the actual color of the building, which remains consistent with Avinor's approval.\n\nThe document dated 14.4.2023 outlines changes made to window sizes and colors in new drawings, reflecting those presented in the application to Avinor. The municipality is unclear about potential legal issues regarding the changes, including variances to window design and facade color. The facade of the hotel building will remain gray, with shades of gray appearing differently in various lighting conditions or weather, as previously approved by Avinor.\n\nThe document, dated 6.9.2022, shows that the initial application was for signage installation on the facade, but the color shown may have created confusion with the municipality. A revised application includes updated window sizes and the actual color of the hotel building, in line with Avinor's approval. The municipality's response on 14.4.2023 suggests that vertical displacements are acceptable, but window changes and facade color still need to be applied for.\n\nThe document dated 2.3 specifies that the purpose of the area is for hotel/accommodation. There are no building or division restrictions for the property. The project does not trigger any planning requirements.\n\nIn 1788, the property was zoned for use as a hotel/accommodation. There are no building or division prohibitions for the property, and the project does not trigger any planning requirements. The application includes changes to the facades of the building based on previous communications with the municipality.\n\nThe document outlines the requirements for architectural projects under the planning and building law, emphasizing the need for good visual quality in design and execution. Dated 2007-2008, it explains that the standard for \"good visual quality\" should be based on professional norms rather than personal opinions of beauty. The document also discusses the criteria for assessing visual quality in both the building itself and its surroundings, stressing the importance of harmonizing with the environment.\n\nThe decision to use concrete elements for the building was made after a thorough assessment of colors and surface structure, as shown in earlier planning drawings. White concrete was initially considered but deemed unsuitable due to potential discoloration and reflection issues; ultimately, black concrete was chosen for its durability and appearance. The combination of the black concrete with lighter, golden window panels was believed to create an inviting and enduring facade, aligning well with the building's role as a practical and functional hotel. (No specific date mentioned in the document)\n\nDokumentet diskuterer endringer i vindusst\u00f8rrelser p\u00e5 et byggetiltak, begrunnet i valgt byggemetode og dagslyskrav i TEK 17 \u00a7 13-12. Endringen ble vurdert som ikke s\u00f8knadspliktig da fasadens karakter ikke endret seg vesentlig. Bygget anses \u00e5 ha gode visuelle kvaliteter i henhold til plan- og bygningsloven \u00a7 29-2, som sikrer at bygget skal gi uttrykk for sin funksjon og ivareta visuelle kvaliteter i prosjektering og utf\u00f8relse. (Dato for dokumentet er ikke oppgitt)\n\nThe document, Ot. prp. nr. 45 (2007-2008), outlines that decisions regarding \"good visual quality\" should be based on professional standards, not personal opinions of aesthetics. Pbl. \u00a7 29-2 states that good visual quality requires both aesthetic qualities in the project itself and in relation to its surroundings. The choice of building materials and colors should be carefully considered to harmonize with the environment and avoid issues like staining or glare.\n\nThe document describes the consideration and decision-making process behind choosing a black concrete facade for a building in Troms\u00f8. The facade includes polished concrete on the gable wall and a rough, vertical matrix on the long sides, complemented by golden window sills to create an inviting and durable appearance. Changes in window sizes were made due to construction constraints but were deemed insignificant as the overall character of the facade remained intact. The choice of maintenance-free materials for the facade also aligns with the regulatory requirements. (Date of document not provided)\n\nThe windows in the building are mostly at the same height on each floor and in the same vertical grid, with some new windows added on the shorter facades for more light and fire safety purposes. The building is considered to have good visual qualities and function well according to AT Arkitektur. The building's construction and natural surroundings will continue to meet the municipality's criteria for visual quality as outlined in the building permit issued on May 15, 2020.\n\nThe document, dated before 1995, discusses the approval of a building facade by Avinor and the compliance with regulations. It states that the current planning regulations do not specify requirements for facade design or color, as seen in the case of property gnr. 118 bnr. 1016. It emphasizes that the town must allow for a significant level of discretion in the architectural choices made by developers, as long as they meet reasonable aesthetic standards.\n\nSivilombudet i 1981 fastslo at bestemmelser ang\u00e5ende skj\u00f8nnhetsvurderinger i plan- og bygningsloven m\u00e5 brukes med varsomhet. En rettssak i 1995 viste at avslag bare kan gis hvis det er \u00e5penbart at kravene ikke er oppfylt. Til slutt p\u00e5pekes at en kommende bygning vil v\u00e6re godt tilpasset omgivelsene, til tross for \u00e5 rive et vindu i et uthus.\n\nThe document discusses building heights in accordance with the current zoning plan and the importance of considering the visual expression of the buildings. It mentions requirements for material use and facade design in relation to aviation authority guidelines. The document also notes that specific requirements for facade design or color are not included in the zoning plan, but that considerations for surroundings and aesthetics have been met.\n\nThe document discusses the interpretation and application of Plan- og bygningsloven \u00a7 29-2, emphasizing the municipality's limited authority to impose restrictions on architectural choices. The document includes references to legal precedents and guidelines regarding building aesthetics and design. It also addresses notification to neighbors and the absence of a requirement for dispensation from laws or regulations for the proposed project.

The municipality can issue a permit to commence construction once Arbeidstilsynet's approval is in place, with the applicant required to pay a processing fee and having the option to appeal the decision within three weeks.On February 7, 2022, B\u00f8rre Mofoss raised concerns about safety issues on a pedestrian and cycling path due to construction activities for a new hotel in Troms\u00f8. He questioned whether the developer was using the path improperly and requested proper measures be taken. On February 11, 2022, Regine Ada Aasjord M\u00f8kleby responded, indicating that the issue had been forwarded for follow-up by the county's excavation service.The document dated 02.06.2023 grants temporary use permit and dispensation from sequence requirements for property 118/1016. The permit is based on the information provided, and there is an option to appeal the decision to the State Administration in Troms and Finnmark within three weeks of receiving the decision.

Avinor has reviewed and approved the lighting plan for the construction period in accordance with safety regulations. The document also addresses changes in material use and facade design, ensuring that there are no adverse effects on radio technology.The document is an approval for the commencement of construction work at Huldervegen 2, with specific conditions to be met. It was issued on April 1, 2022, by the AT arkitektur, confirming that previous approvals for groundwork had been given. The decision can be appealed to Statsforvalteren in Troms and Finnmark within three weeks of receiving the decision.The document is an application for temporary use permit for a building located in Troms\u00f8, with a request for completion by 25.04.2023. The remaining minor construction work is specified in the application, and safety measures have been deemed sufficient for initial use. The responsible applicant is AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS, and the application includes attachments for safety instructions and approval for water connection.The document dated 21.08.2020 from Troms\u00f8 kommune concerns the building of a hotel on Huldervegen 2. Avinor has issued additional conditions for the project, including the need for a flow analysis and approval from Avinor before construction begins. Avinor filed a conditional complaint on the building permit, which includes requirements for a flow analysis, approval for crane use, and a lighting plan.The document dated August 11, 2022, grants an igangsettingstillatelse for innredning, tekniske anlegg, and utomhus for the property at Huldervegen 2, with conditions and responsibilities outlined. The decision is made in accordance with the plan- and building law, and additional information regarding appeal processes, final inspection, and fees are provided. The document is electronically approved and unsigned, with relevant attachments included for reference.The document is an application for temporary use permit for a property located at Huldervegen 2, 9016 TROMS\u00d8, with the municipality reference number 2020 1238. The application was made on 25.04.2023 for the entire project with minor remaining works, with sufficient safety level for immediate use. The responsible applicant is AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS, represented by Berit Ballari, with contact information provided.\n\nThe document is a permit application for a construction project, signed on April 28, 2023, by AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS. The project is located at Huldervegen 2 in Troms\u00f8. The document outlines the responsibilities of different parties involved in the project, such as the responsible project planner and the planned completion dates for various tasks.\n\nThe document is a summary report of various construction projects with different contractors and completion dates ranging from January to June 2022. It includes details about different aspects of the construction process such as architecture, fire safety, building physics, geotechnics, construction safety, and more. The responsible applicant for the projects is AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS, and the document is signed electronically by BERIT JOHANNE GUTTORM BALLARI on behalf of the company.AT Arkitektur received a letter from the municipality on November 22, 2022, regarding discrepancies in the facade of a hotel building being constructed compared to the approved facade design in the building permit from May 15, 2020. The municipality has forwarded complaints received on November 21, 2022, and is negative towards the application for support walls beyond the formal or building limits. AT Arkitektur will respond to the municipality's assessment regarding the facade, support walls, calculation of usable area, and complaints received. The visual qualities of the hotel building and its placement were emphasized in AT Arkitektur's application for the building permit.\n\nThe document discusses the design of a hotel building in Troms\u00f8 with tilted outer walls and vertical window bands to create a dynamic and visually appealing structure. There are concerns raised by the municipality about deviations in the facade construction from the approved plan and the need for proper permits for structures within green areas. The architect firm, A*T Arkitektur, will address these concerns and provide a response to complaints received regarding the building project.\n\nThe document refers to a letter from the municipality dated November 22, 2022, regarding a possible error in the calculation of the floor area of a hotel building. The visual qualities of the hotel building were highlighted in the application for the building permit, emphasizing its dynamic form and playful facade design. The municipality granted the building permit for the hotel in May 2020, stating that the building is in line with the current zoning plan and has visual qualities that complement its surroundings.\n\nThe document discusses the visual qualities and building height restrictions of a hotel property, with specific requirements for Avinor's approval of materials and colors. The municipality confirmed that the building design met regulations and granted approval for the hotel construction on May 15, 2020. The document also mentioned ongoing correspondence with Avinor regarding finalizing facade colors and materials.\n\nThe document, dated but not specified, evaluates the visual qualities of a hotel property designated for hotel/accommodation use with a maximum height of +44.0, consisting of 11 floors with slanted and tilted outer walls. The municipality did not specify requirements for materials and color choice, only that Avinor must approve them for the building permit. The use of \"black concrete\" as a facade material was initially proposed but was deemed unsuitable by Avinor due to potential safety issues with reflectivity near the airport.\n\nThe document, dated at an unspecified time, discusses the choice of high-quality concrete as the facade material for a building near an airport to avoid negative reflections. The concrete will appear dark gray, not black, due to its resistance to staining from road dust in a busy traffic area. The illustrations presented to the municipality and Avinor show the facade color as gray, varying in appearance depending on lighting conditions.\n\nIn the process, several facade materials were considered, with a preference for non-reflective materials to avoid negative consequences for airport safety. Polished concrete was ultimately chosen as the facade material, with vertical grooves to prevent reflection towards the airport. The building's facade will appear darker in wet conditions but will have a grayish color in daylight, matching the illustrations submitted in the permit application. The municipality noted discrepancies between the ongoing construction and the initial proposal on November 16, 2022.\n\nThe document states that the facades of the building do not match the approved plans and need to be reapplied for. The municipality's assessment is based on the approved visual qualities and window bands with vertical shifts. The municipality did not consider all the information provided in the application to Avinor, but the final facade color is intended to be gray as shown in the illustration.\n\nThe document, dated November 22, 2022, addresses the municipality's concerns about a building under construction not having vertical displacement window bands, noting that the building is still in progress and no temporary occupancy permit or final certificate has been applied for. The windows have been slightly altered in shape due to the chosen concrete element design. The municipality, based on their assessment of visual qualities in the original application, has determined that the building's facades need to be reapplied for approval.\n\nThe document discusses discrepancies in the facade material and color of a building presented to the municipality and Avinor on March 6, 2022. It explains that despite being labeled as \"black concrete,\" the material will appear grey upon completion, with some parts of the building also using grey material. The document also addresses the absence of vertical window bands during the construction process, noting adjustments made to the windows for structural reasons, while questioning the municipality's critique of a building still under construction without temporary use permits or final inspection.\n\nThe vertical expression in the window bands is maintained, but the fittings that connect the windows in vertical sections have not been installed yet, as the project execution is not at that stage yet. The adjustments in the windows are considered to be within the normal development of the project and do not trigger the need for a change application, based on similar projects in the municipality. The windows are designed in accordance with the technical minimum requirements for windows outlined in the building regulations (TEK17) \u00a7 13-12 second paragraph.\n\nThe document mentions that windows must have a minimum height of 0.60 m and width of 0.50 m, with a combined minimum of 1.50 m. It questions if the municipality has changed its practices in building cases. AT Arkitektur notes that the municipality did not request information on materials and specific colors before the building permit was issued on May 15, 2020, and discusses minor window adjustments within the project that they believe do not require a change application.\n\nThe document discusses the technical requirements for windows in buildings, specifically focusing on the access to natural light in rooms for permanent use. It also mentions pre-determined performance criteria for daylight requirements in different types of rooms. There are questions raised about the municipality's potential change in building practices in a specific case dated 15.5.2020, where details about materials and colors were not requested during the application process.\n\nThe document discusses the practice of not requiring buildings to be fully detailed at the time of the building permission application. ATA Arkitektur did not receive specific requirements regarding material and color choices from the municipality, but rather conditions for Avinor's approval. The detailed design was presented to Avinor, who approved the facade on March 10, 2022, and there is no significant difference between the illustrations submitted with the applications.\n\nThe document, dated 10.3.2022, presents four prominent buildings in Troms\u00f8 that do not comply with the premises set by the municipality regarding a specific case at Huldervegen 2.1. The architects request a response from the municipality regarding these building projects and inquire if they need to be re-applied due to a change in the municipality's practice. They argue that there are many examples in Troms\u00f8 where final buildings differ from approved illustrations in the initial permit, without issue from the municipality.\n\nThe document, dated 2018, discusses how certain buildings in Troms\u00f8 do not align with the premises set by the municipality in connection with a specific case. It questions whether these building projects need to be reapplied for due to changed practices in the city's planning process. The document provides examples of discrepancies between approved facade designs and the final constructed buildings, highlighting potential issues with the city's building permit approval process.\n\nThe document discusses discrepancies in the facade of a building compared to the approved plans, dated January 29, 2020. Changes in color and materials are noted, with the final facade differing from the initial design. The document raises concerns that the building may not be in compliance with the approved permit based on the premises set by the municipality.\n\nIn 2020, facades facing north were approved as shown in the facade drawing attached to the application. However, there were discrepancies in color and material choices between the approved design and the actual building. The verandas had a different color and design than what was approved in the application, with some elements being more prominent in the visualization than in the actual building photo.\n\nThe document mentions examples of building permits approved by the municipality for Stakkevollvegen 35 and 37/39 on June 16, 2017, but notes discrepancies between the approved facade designs and the completed buildings. The document also discusses a change request for the west, east, and south facades of a building that does not align with the approved drawings provided during the application process. Additionally, it references building permits issued for Stakkevollvegen 57 in Trofi teknopark in 2013 and 2017 under different municipal case numbers.\n\nThe document mentions examples of building approvals in Trofi teknopark, with one from 2013 based on a drawing attached to the application and another from 2017 without colored drawings but approved based on visual qualities. It also discusses the discrepancy between approved buildings and their actual construction compared to the premises outlined by the municipality. Additionally, it addresses the issue of support walls along property boundaries in relation to green area regulations in a letter dated 22.11.2022.\n\nI et brev fra kommunen datert 23.11.2022, under sak BYGG-22/01932, nekter de \u00e5 innvilge dispensasjonss\u00f8knad for st\u00f8ttemur utover form\u00e5ls- og byggegrenser mot veien, med negativ h\u00f8ringsuttalelse fra Troms og Finnmark fylkeskommune samme dag. AT Arkitektur anerkjenner at det burde v\u00e6rt s\u00f8kt om dispensasjon for st\u00f8ttemurene, men ber kommunen om klarhet ang\u00e5ende hvilken vurdering de skal forholde seg til, og ber om utsatt s\u00f8knadsfrist frem til andre saker er avklart. Klagerne hevder at de ikke har klagerett, og det p\u00e5pekes at bygningene ikke samsvarer med gitte tillatelser gitt premisser i en tidligere sak.\n\nThe document from 2022, under sak BYGG-20/01238, discusses the application for the construction of a retaining wall along the property boundary to the west, with the concern that it may require a dispensation due to being within an area regulated for green space. The municipality is negative towards granting a dispensation for the retaining wall beyond the purpose boundary or building boundary towards the road, based on a negative consultation response from Troms and Finnmark County dated 23.11.2022. A complaint by ATArkitektur questions the municipality's handling and requests clarity on which case and assessment to follow regarding the retaining wall.\n\nThe document discusses the criteria for being considered a party in dispensation applications, stating that neighbors with a valid protest have judicial standing. It argues that those who have complained about the decisions do not have the status of neighbors or adjacent landowners. The document also mentions that complaints made after a year from the decision cannot be considered, as stated in \u00a7 31 third paragraph of the Public Administration Act.\n\nThe document refers to the annual report of the Parliamentary Ombudsman from 1985, stating that the opportunity to grant redress (i.e. to waive the deadline for complaints) is not unlimited. The rule must be interpreted as absolute, meaning that there is no opportunity for reimbursement of legal costs after the deadline has expired. The absolute one-year deadline for complaints also applies to situations where parties were not informed of their right to appeal a decision.\n\nBased on the document, it is argued that complaints filed in relation to previous decisions in building cases may be rejected if the complaints are made after the prescribed deadline. The document emphasizes the importance of adhering to the one-year deadline for complaints, as specified in the legal framework. Additionally, there is a call for better predictability in building cases regarding material choices and color schemes, which can be achieved through more specific regulations in future zoning plans or overarching design concepts.Avinor received a wind and turbulence analysis for a new hotel building in Troms\u00f8 dated 04.08.2020, concluding that it meets criteria and will not cause operational issues at the airport.

Due to issues with attachment sizes, the email was sent separately. Ballari requested confirmation of receipt to ensure the documents were delivered successfully.The email sent on March 6, 2022, discusses the progress of a hotel project at Huldervegen 2 in Troms\u00f8, with Avinor and Econor AS involved. There are requests for approval of material usage, facade design, and lighting plans for the construction site and outdoor areas.

The request for dispensation was neighbor-notified on March 28, 2023, and there have been no objections. The dispensation is needed to avoid leaving the finished building vacant while waiting for the final infrastructure work to be completed.\n\nThe document discusses the need for a temporary dispensation from a regulatory plan in order to meet infrastructure obligations relating to a construction project, with a planned takeover of a hotel building on May 15, 2023. Due to weather conditions in Troms\u00f8, the completion of green space, sidewalks, and roads has been delayed, but the developer intends to begin work as soon as conditions allow. The requested dispensation is for the period from May 15, 2023, to July 1, 2023, in order to obtain a temporary use permit.\n\nThe document, dated unspecified, discusses the need for a temporary extension for infrastructure development due to practical reasons related to climate and weather conditions in the north. The developer is obliged to fulfill their obligations to develop infrastructure by 1.7.2023, with temporary solutions proposed for pedestrian safety in the meantime. The primary concern is ensuring the developer meets their obligations for communal infrastructure development outlined in the zoning plan and development agreement.\n\nThe document, dated 2023, explains that due to weather conditions in Troms\u00f8, it is not possible to plant trees and develop common sidewalks and roadways until late May. A temporary dispensation is requested from regulation plan no. 1788 to allow for construction to begin from May 15, 2023 to July 1, 2023, with a commitment to complete the infrastructure by the deadline. The dispensation is sought to account for practical challenges related to the weather in the region, with the understanding that the developer is obligated to fulfill their responsibilities according to the development agreement.\n\nSWECO has designed temporary solutions and conducted a traffic analysis to ensure the safety of pedestrians in the area during the interim period. The temporary dispensation from the zoning regulation is not expected to significantly undermine the purpose behind the regulation, as demonstrated through transparency and input from stakeholders. The delay in infrastructure development is not anticipated to have major consequences for neighbors or the community, with the assurance that the infrastructure will be completed by July 1, 2023.\n\nThe document discusses the assessment of whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of granting temporary dispensation, dated in the present time. The drawback of delaying the completion of common infrastructure by one month is outweighed by the advantages of having security for development in the form of a development agreement and ensuring the safety of pedestrians during construction. The conditions for granting temporary dispensation from regulation plan provision VI letter f) are considered to be met, according to the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 19-2 second paragraph.\n\nThe temporary dispensation from the zoning plan regulations will not significantly undermine the purpose behind the regulations, as stated in the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 19-2 paragraph 2. The dispensation will not significantly undermine the fundamental considerations that the Planning and Building Act aims to safeguard, and it will not have direct consequences for the environment and society. The assessment weighs the advantages against the disadvantages of granting the temporary dispensation, with the main disadvantage being a one-month delay in completing the shared infrastructure, offset by the benefits of ensuring safety and allowing the hotel building to be used upon completion.\n\nBased on the climate and weather conditions in Northern Norway, it is deemed unreasonable not to grant temporary use permits during the winter months due to the inability to develop infrastructure when snow and frost are present. The advantages of granting an exemption outweigh the disadvantages, as outlined in the planning and building law section 19-2. Conditions for granting temporary exemption from regulation VI letter f) in the zoning plan are considered met, according to the planning and building law section 19-2.\n\nThe document discusses the infrastructure included in the Langnes area plan and the developer's responsibility for funding certain projects within the plan. Infrastructure that is solely financed by the developer does not need to be completed before temporary use permits are issued, in accordance with the development agreement. The developer is responsible for contributing financially to specific infrastructure projects outlined in the plan, which must be completed before the municipality takes over.\n\nThe document, dated 1788, discusses the importance of developers fulfilling their obligations to develop public infrastructure outlined in the regulatory plan for Langnes. In this particular case, the developer is committed to meeting these obligations through the agreed-upon development agreement with the municipality and is planning to begin infrastructure work after the planned takeover of the hotel building on May 15, 2023. Despite delays due to weather conditions in Troms\u00f8, including the need for snow to melt before asphalt can be laid, the developer is seeking a temporary dispensation from the regulatory plan to proceed with the infrastructure work.\n\nThe document mentions a delay in the process of completing public infrastructure to be taken over by the municipality, due to challenges in finalizing the planning before receiving comments and approval from the municipality. The total cost for the required measures is estimated to be 70,546,875 NOK, with the developer responsible for paying 1,623,000 NOK as their share. There is a request for temporary dispensation from all public infrastructure requirements in the regulations, including those in the area plan for Langnes, while emphasizing the importance of fulfilling obligations to develop the public infrastructure outlined in the regulations.\n\nThe developer is committed to fulfilling obligations outlined in the regulatory plan and development agreement with the municipality, including the development of public infrastructure required by the regulatory plan. Due to weather conditions in Troms\u00f8, it is not possible to finish the infrastructure work before the planned handover of the hotel building on May 15, 2023. The delay is also partly due to the municipality's lengthy processing time for technical plans related to public infrastructure. The request is for a temporary dispensation from the regulatory plan from May 15, 2023 to July 1, 2023.\n\nIn 1788, provision VI letter h) specifies the need to obtain temporary use permits before applying for funds, as per the Planning and Building Act section 19-3. The purpose is to ensure that the developer fulfills their obligations to develop the appropriate infrastructure. There are temporary solutions planned for the public infrastructure in the area until the completion of the infrastructure.\n\nThe temporary dispensation will not significantly undermine the fundamental considerations that the planning and building law should safeguard, and it will not have direct consequences for the environment and society. It is emphasized that transparency and participation have been ensured in the process by notifying neighbors of the dispensation. The advantages of granting the temporary dispensation outweigh the disadvantages, as it will allow the hotel building to be put to use upon completion, with only a minor delay in the fulfillment of the public infrastructure.\n\nThe conditions for granting temporary dispensation from provision VI letter h) in zoning plan are considered to be fulfilled, according to the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 19-2 second paragraph. The application is only for temporary dispensation from 15.5.2023 to 1.7.2023, before applying for temporary use permit, in accordance with the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 19-3. It is assessed that the temporary dispensation will not significantly undermine the purpose behind provision VI letter h) of the zoning plan, as proper infrastructure development obligations will still be met within the specified timeline.\n\nThe document discusses the temporary dispensation from zoning regulations, stating that it will not significantly undermine the purpose of the regulations and that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It mentions examples of similar cases in Troms\u00f8 municipality where temporary dispensations were granted. The conclusion is that there is a basis for granting the temporary dispensation based on the assessment that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, in line with the municipality's practices.The document is related to a building permit issued by Troms\u00f8 Kommune on September 18, 2020, for work on Huldervegen 2.
