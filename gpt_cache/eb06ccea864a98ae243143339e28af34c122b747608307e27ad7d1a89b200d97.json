"The document is an application for permission for construction activities in accordance with building regulations. It includes details to be registered in the land register. The application also covers requirements for a three-week processing period, the need for a declaration of responsibility, and compliance with regulations before the construction commences. The document is dated March 19, 2020.On April 3, 2023, Troms and Finnmark County Council received a neighbor notice for a temporary use permit for Workinntunet Hotel in Troms\u00f8. The application includes a request for dispensation from regulations in zoning plan no. 1788. The county council acknowledges the notice and indicates that further approval may be required if the project impacts their jurisdiction.The document is a building permit application for a facade change on a hotel building at Huldervegen 2. It was submitted on April 20, 2023, to Troms\u00f8 municipality by AT Arkitektur AS on behalf of Huldervegen 2 AS. The application includes details about the responsible parties for the project and the proposed changes to the building's facade.\n\nAT Arkitektur sought approval on April 21, 2020 to build a hotel at Huldervegen 2 in Troms\u00f8, emphasizing the visual qualities of the building in their application. The municipality of Troms\u00f8 approved the building plan on May 15, 2020, stating that the hotel has good visual qualities in relation to its function and surroundings. The hotel's design includes dynamic forms, playful facades with vertical windows, and a rooftop landscape visible during approach to Troms\u00f8.\n\nThe property is designated for a hotel/accommodation with a maximum height of +44.0 meters with 11 floors featuring slanted and tilted outer walls that will appear different from different perspectives. The hotel will stand tall in the area but is considered well-adapted to its built surroundings characterized by industrial and commercial buildings. AT Arkitektur applied for a building permit on April 21, 2020, for the construction of a hotel on the property, emphasizing the visual qualities of the building.\n\nThe document from AT Arkitektur mentions that the hotel has good visual qualities in relation to itself, its function, and its surroundings, with a maximum height of +44.0 meters. The municipality did not specify requirements for the use of materials and colors, but Avinor's approval is necessary for the final facade design. It is stated that the municipality was informed during the clarification process with Avinor and did not raise objections or demand changes regarding the facade design.\n\nThe document, dated but not provided, presents a detailed illustration of a hotel building's facade material, ultimately choosing polished concrete with vertical grooves to avoid negative reflections towards the airport, despite being described as \"black concrete\". The choice of material aims to maintain a high-quality facade appearance over time without negative effects from dust and traffic in the area, with the color appearing gray during the day and nearly black at night. Despite being labeled as \"black concrete\", the final appearance of the facade will be more grayish in daylight, matching the illustrations presented in the initial application to the municipality.\n\nThe document, dated [date], discusses the requirements for material use and color selection in a building application to the municipality and Avinor. While the municipality did not specify material and color requirements, Avinor's approval was necessary for the final decision. After considering various materials, concrete was chosen for the facade to avoid negative reflections towards the airport while maintaining high quality.\n\nFargemessig vil den m\u00f8rke gr\u00e5 betongen st\u00e5 seg over tid uten negative konsekvenser fra vegst\u00f8v. Det p\u00e5pekes at \"svart betong\" ikke er det samme som den generelle oppfatningen av fargen svart. Igangsettingstillatelse for ulike bygningsarbeid ble gitt p\u00e5 ulike datoer, og det ble oppdaget avvik i fasaden under oppf\u00f8ring som m\u00e5 oms\u00f8kes p\u00e5 nytt i brev datert 22.11.2022.\n\nIn 2022, the municipality approved the building's visual qualities based on the illustration submitted in the application, showing a gray facade and approved window bands with vertical shifts. AT Arkitektur believes that the municipality did not have all the necessary information when they concluded that the facades needed to be re-applied in a letter dated 22.11.2022. The municipality did not seem to consider the information provided in the application to Avinor dated 6.3.2022, which detailed the material usage and showed a gray facade.\n\nThe building under construction does not have the specified vertical window bands yet due to being at an early stage of construction. There have been some minor adjustments to the windows compared to the initial drawings, but the overall design concept remains consistent. The municipality has raised concerns about the facade not aligning with the approved plans and has requested a new application for the building's exterior.\n\nIn 2022, it is stated that the municipality did not have all the information regarding a planning application. The drawings presented to the municipality and Avinor showed a gray facade, with details on the material use explained in the application. The construction of the building was still in progress, with changes to the windows being made, including wider windows and adjustments in height, while the vertical elements were not yet installed.\n\nThe document from AT Arkitektur, dated 16.3.2023, states that minor adjustments to windows in a project are considered normal and do not require a change application. The municipality has issued a notice of correction for changes to the facade and threatens enforcement from the applicant due to alterations in window height, width, and placement.\nThe email sent in response to the municipality's notice on 29.3.2023 sought clarification on the facade changes, explaining that vertical shifts in the windows, intended for a playful aesthetic, had not yet been finalized in the project. Additionally, it acknowledged that the window sizes had been slightly altered, with an increase in width of 20 cm.\n\nThe background is that a more suitable solution for sun shading was found in the detailed project, resulting in changes to window sizes to comply with daylight requirements in TEK17 \u00a7 13-7 and following. The decision not to seek approval for the window changes was based on the belief that the building's character would not be significantly altered as it was considered a technical adjustment. The municipality's notice dated 16.3.2023 indicates that the facade must be changed to match the approval or a new application must be submitted, citing changes in color and window size as key issues.\n\nThe windows do not have the vertical displacements as shown on the approved drawings. The vertical displacements were supposed to give the facade a \"playful and lively expression.\" An email was sent to the municipality on March 29, 2023, seeking clarification about the facade changes following the municipality's notice of an order. Although the sizes of the windows have been slightly altered, the character of the facade is considered unchanged, and the deviation from the approved window sizes is not significant according to the measurement rules.\n\nThe document from AT Arkitektur, dated 12.12.2022, mentions changes to window size and placement, as well as a retracted point on the west side of the building which are considered modifications to the original approval. The document clarifies that the facade of the hotel building will remain grey as shown in the initial illustration, with variations in shade depending on lighting and weather. There is confusion regarding the color of the facade in a notice for corrective action from the municipality, which AT Arkitektur attributes to a misunderstanding of the color specified in a sign application from September 6, 2022.\n\nNew drawings have been created with updated window sizes and colors as shown in the attached facade drawings. It is unclear if the municipality considers these changes to be illegal, as they were presented in the application to Avinor. The municipality has stated that vertical displacements are in line with the permit, but changes to windows and facade color must be applied for as modifications.\n\nThe document discusses a planning application for installing signage on a hotel building, with revisions made to window sizes and colors following feedback from the municipality. The municipality received the application on 6.9.2022 and later provided feedback on 14.4.2023, indicating that vertical displacements are permissible but changes to windows and the facade color require further application. The property is designated for commercial use in the municipal and area plans, with specific regulations for hotel accommodations.\n\nThe document discusses land use allocation for a hotel/accommodation. There are no building or subdivision restrictions for the property. The project does not trigger any planning requirements.\n\nIn 1788, the property was zoned for a hotel or overnight accommodation. There are no building or sharing restrictions on the property, and the proposed development does not trigger any planning requirements. The responsible party acknowledges some unapproved changes to the facade and windows, seeking approval for these modifications after discussions with the municipality.\n\nThe document from AT Arkitektur dated on page 7 and 8 discusses the requirements for building projects in compliance with the Planning and Building Act. The standard for \"good visual quality\" emphasizes professional quality norms over personal opinions. It emphasizes that a building must have good aesthetic qualities both in itself and in relation to its surroundings.\n\nIt was decided that the building would be constructed with concrete elements, with a thorough evaluation of colors and surface structure. After considering white and light gray, black concrete was chosen for the facade due to its ability to avoid looking dirty over time and its compatibility with the busy location in Troms\u00f8. The combination of black concrete with golden window areas was considered to create an inviting facade that would age well and complement the hotel's function as a practical and functional accommodation building. This information is from earlier planning drawings for the building.\n\nThe document discusses the changes in window sizes due to construction methods and the need to meet daylight requirements. These changes were considered not requiring a new application as the overall facade design remained consistent. The building is deemed to have good visual qualities and to meet the requirements of the Planning and Building Act in terms of visual aesthetics and functionality. The document emphasizes the importance of ensuring that all construction projects reflect their function visually and maintain other visual qualities in their design and execution.\n\nThe document, from Ot. prp. nr. 45 (2007-2008), discusses the requirement for good visual qualities in building projects to be based on professional quality standards rather than personal opinions. Pbl. \u00a7 29-2 outlines the two main criteria for assessing visual quality in buildings - good aesthetic qualities both in the building itself and in relation to its surroundings. The decision-making process for choosing building materials and colors, such as opting for concrete over white due to long-term discoloration and reflection issues, is discussed in relation to maintaining visual harmony with the surrounding environment.\n\nThe document discusses the considerations and choices made regarding the facade design of a building in Troms\u00f8. A black concrete facade was chosen, with a polished surface on the gable wall and a rough, vertical matrix surface on the long facades. The choice of materials and colors was made to ensure that the building has an inviting facade that will age well over time, while also meeting the requirement for maintenance-free materials. Changes in window sizes were made due to construction constraints, but the overall character of the facade was not significantly altered.\n\nThe windows are mostly at the same height in each floor with vertical window bands in both the planning drawings and currently, with some windows added on the short facades for more light and smoke evacuation needs. The building is considered to have good visual qualities for both its design and function. The construction and natural surroundings will continue to adhere to the municipality's visual quality considerations outlined in the building permit of May 15, 2020, with the property designated for a hotel with 11 floors and in line with existing regulations and requirements for materials and facade design respecting aviation guidelines.\n\nMaterial selection and facade design for a building project have been presented to Avinor in accordance with the regulations and conditions set out by the municipality in the building permit. Avinor has previously approved the facade in question, and we believe the building has good visual qualities in relation to its surroundings. The regulations for the property do not specify a particular facade design or color, and according to the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 29-2 as it stood before the 1995 amendment, the project must meet reasonable aesthetic requirements.\n\nIn a statement from the Parliamentary Ombudsman in 1981, it was emphasized that the rejection of a building permit must be done cautiously, only if it is indisputable that the aesthetic criteria are not met. This was upheld in a decision by the Eidsivating Court of Appeal in 1995. The case involved the validity of a demolition order for a bay window in an outhouse, highlighting the importance of considering expert opinions and local views in such matters.\n\nThe document discusses that the building heights comply with the current zoning plan and emphasizes that the evaluation should focus on the expression of the building. It mentions that the design and materials used in the construction have been approved by Avinor and meet the requirements set by the municipality. There are no specific requirements for facade design or color in the zoning plan for the property in question, as stated in the document dated between 1989 and 2019.\n\nThe document discusses the interpretation of Plan- og bygningsloven \u00a7 29-2, emphasizing that the municipality should not unduly restrict architectural choices and should accept a wide margin of discretion for the developer. It also mentions the need for careful application of the law regarding aesthetic considerations, as highlighted in legal cases. The responsible applicant asserts that the visual qualities of the hotel project align with the requirements of the law.Arbeidstilsynet gir samtykke til planene for oppf\u00f8ring av et nytt hotell i Troms\u00f8, med 11 etasjer og et frittliggende bygg for avfall og trafo, etter \u00e5 ha mottatt og vurdert n\u00f8dvendig dokumentasjon datert 27.09.2021.

He questions whether the developer is using the path without authorization and calls for changes to ensure safety. Regine Ada Aasjord M\u00f8kleby responded, saying the matter has been forwarded for follow-up as the path is part of a county road.This document, dated 02.06.2023, is a decision regarding a temporary use permit and dispensation for property Huldervegen 2. The responsible applicant is AT arkitektur and the property owner is HULDERVEGEN 2 AS. The decision grants a temporary use permit for the entire project and dispensation from certain order requirements until 01.07.2023.The document, dated 09.03.2022, from Avinor addresses a lighting plan and changes to material use and facade design for a hotel building in Troms\u00f8. Avinor has reviewed the lighting plan and found it satisfactory, but may make adjustments if pilots or control tower personnel report issues during operations at Troms\u00f8 airport. The use of black and polished concrete for the facade of the building is also discussed, with minimal differences noted in comparison to previous assessments.The document dated April 1, 2022, is an approval for the construction of a building in Huldervegen 2, Troms\u00f8. The permit is for the structural system, enclosure of the building, and water and sewage systems.

Avinor has raised concerns about potential interference with airport operations due to the construction, and additional analyses and approvals are required before work can proceed. The responsible party for the project acknowledges the requirements and is working to meet them to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid potential issues with Avinor.The document dated August 11, 2022, grants an igangsettingstillatelse for parts of a construction project at Huldervegen 2 in Troms\u00f8. The decision is based on the approved delegationsinstruks and previous permits dating back to May 13, 2020. The responsible parties, such as the applicant and the building authorities, are outlined in the document, along with information about appeals, responsibilities, and fees.The document is a request for temporary use permit for a building located in Troms\u00f8, with the application submitted on April 25, 2023. The application is for the entire building, with minor remaining work to be completed before a final inspection. The responsible applicant is AT PLAN & ARCHITECTURE AS, represented by Berit Ballari, with contact information provided.\n\nThe document is a planning document related to a construction project signed electronically on April 28, 2023, by Berit Johanne Guttorm Ballari on behalf of AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS. It includes information about the organizations involved, contact details, and responsibilities. The document outlines the implementation plan and responsibilities assigned to different parties involved in the project.\n\nThe document outlines various construction projects with different responsibilities assigned to different companies, including architecture, fire alarm systems, building physics, geotechnics, and construction safety. The document is dated 28.04.2023 and includes information on project approvals and completion. An electronic signature from AT PLAN & ARKITEKTUR AS is included in the document.AT Arkitektur received a letter from the municipality on November 22, 2022, regarding discrepancies in the hotel building facade being constructed compared to the approved facade in the building permit issued on May 15, 2020. The municipality has also raised concerns about the establishment of retaining walls beyond the designated area and building limits, with a negative response to the application. AT Arkitektur will address the municipality's assessments regarding the facade, retaining walls, calculation of usable area, and responses to received complaints.\n\nThe document describes the design of a hotel building with tilted walls to create a dynamic form perceived differently from various angles. Vertical window bands add a playful and lively expression to the facade, complemented by a large glass panel on the top floor. The document, dated December 12, 2022, discusses issues related to the construction of the hotel building, including deviations from approved plans, complaints from the community, and the need for permits for certain structures.\n\nThe document refers to a letter from the municipality dated November 22, 2022, regarding a possible error in the calculation of the hotel building's floor area. The calculation of the floor area was provided in an email on December 6, 2022. The municipality granted approval for the hotel building in May 15, 2020, stating that the building meets the visual quality standards within the existing zoning regulations and fits well with the surrounding natural environment.\n\nThe document, dated 15.5.2020, discusses the approval of a hotel building with a maximum height of +44.0 and 11 floors, which is deemed to be well-suited to its industrial and business surroundings by the municipality. The municipality did not specify material or color requirements, only that approval from Avinor is needed for these aspects. The visual qualities of the building were evaluated by the municipality, which stated that it is in line with the existing regulations and fits well in its surroundings.\n\nThe hotel's visual qualities and height are in line with the municipality's regulations, with its design being deemed suitable for the surrounding industrial and business buildings. Specific requirements for materials and colors were not set by the municipality, instead, approval from Avinor was necessary for these aspects. The use of \"black concrete\" as a material for the facade was proposed, but concerns were raised about its appearance and potential impact on flight safety if it was reflective or smooth.\n\nThe document discusses the choice of concrete as the facade material for a building near an airport, to avoid negative reflections and ensure high quality. Despite being described as \"black concrete,\" the facade will actually appear gray during the day and almost black at night, depending on lighting conditions. The illustrations submitted to the municipality and airport authority show the building's facade in the same shades of gray. \n\nDate of document: Not specified.\n\nSeveral facade materials were considered in the process, with a focus on avoiding reflective/smooth materials that could have negative implications for airport safety. Polished concrete was ultimately chosen for the facade to prevent negative reflections towards the airport. The building's facade color will appear dark gray (\"black concrete\") when completed, with variations in shade depending on lighting conditions. The municipality noted discrepancies in the facade appearance of the building under construction compared to the initial application description.\n\nThe document, dated 22.11.2022, concludes that the facades of the building do not align with the approved permit and must be reapplied for. The municipality's assessment is based on the approved visual qualities of the building and the approved window bands with vertical displacement. The municipality did not consider all the information from the application to Avinor dated 6.3.2022, where the illustration showed a gray facade, and the material used would appear gray when finished.\n\nThe building in question is still under construction and has not yet applied for temporary use or a completion certificate. The windows have been slightly altered in size and shape due to the use of concrete elements. The municipality has raised concerns about the building's facade not matching the approved plans and vertical window bands, and has requested a new application be submitted based on this discrepancy.\n\nThe document, dated March 6, 2022, discusses the use of \"black concrete\" which appears gray in the final building facade. The application to Avinor outlines the material usage and acknowledges that the facade drawings were not finalized. The document also addresses the absence of vertical window bands in the building under construction, explaining modifications to accommodate concrete elements.\n\nDet vertikale uttrykket i vindusbanene opprettholdes, men beslagene som binder dem sammen er enn\u00e5 ikke montert. Mindre justeringer i vinduene anses som en normal utvikling i prosjektet og krever ikke endringss\u00f8knad. Vinduene oppfyller de tekniske minimumskravene til dagslys.\n\nThe document outlines regulations for window dimensions, questioning if the municipality has changed its practices in building cases. AT Arkitektur raises concerns over the municipality's apparent change in building practices, particularly regarding material use and color choices. The document highlights that the municipality only required Avinor's approval for material use and color choices before starting construction, and minor adjustments to windows are considered normal project development without requiring further approval.\n\nThe document discusses requirements for daylight access in rooms for permanent occupancy, referencing technical regulations. It also mentions preaccepted performance criteria for verifying daylight levels in rooms. Additionally, it questions potential changes in the municipality's building permit practices, specifically regarding material usage and color details in a recent case dated 15.5.2020.\n\nThe document, dated May 15, 2020, discusses the architectural practice of not requiring buildings to be fully detailed at the time of a framework application. It mentions that there is typically flexibility in architectural choices during the detailed design phase as long as the project is \"adequately finished\" in terms of its architectural expression for the municipality to assess. The detailed design was presented to Avinor, meeting the municipality's requirements, and the facade was approved by Avinor on March 10, 2022, indicating consistency between the submitted illustrations and the final building design in similar cases in Troms\u00f8 municipality where buildings were not identical to initial illustrations due to incomplete detailing at the framework application.\n\nAT Architecture will present four prominent buildings in Troms\u00f8 for further discussion, which they believe do not align with the premises set by the municipality in regards to a current case in Huldervegen 2.1. They are requesting the municipality to respond to their arguments regarding these building projects, and to clarify if they need to reapply due to a change in the municipality's practice of detailed project planning at the time of the application. AT Architecture assumes that the municipality has a consistent practice in building cases and provides several examples, such as the approval of facade designs for Clodiusbakken 7 on December 19, 2018.\n\nATArkitektur will in the future present four prominent buildings in Troms\u00f8 that they believe do not align with the premises set by the municipality in connection with the current case in Huldervegen 2. The document is dated 19.12.2018 and requests the municipality to respond to their concerns regarding these building projects and whether they need to be re-applied for due to a potential change in practice. The examples provided include Clodiusbakken 7, where the facade of the building appears to have changed from the original drawings approved by the municipality.\n\nThe document discusses discrepancies in the appearance of building facades compared to approved permits, citing a specific case in Huldervegen 2 and another in Strandvegen 94,96 and 98 from January 29, 2020. Changes in color tone and materials are noted in the completed buildings compared to the initial plans, with differences in window designs and roof colors also observed. It is suggested that these deviations may not be in line with the approved permits and the premises set by the municipality.\n\nIn 2020, facades facing north were approved as shown in the attached facade drawing for a building. However, the actual building facade differed in color and material choices from what was approved. Additionally, certain elements of the verandas were not in line with the approved design.\n\nThe document mentions examples of approved facades in Stakkevollvegen 35 and Stakkevollvegen 37/39, known as the State Road Authority Building, on June 16, 2017. The images of the completed building show discrepancies from the approved drawings, specifically the absence of red elements that were supposed to contrast with the dark facade. Additionally, another building in Trofi Technopark was approved by the municipality on January 7, 2013, and May 4, 2017, under separate cases.\n\nIn the document dated 22.11.2022, the municipality mentions the approval of a building's visual qualities in relation to previous cases 12/8048 and 17/2074, despite the lack of colored drawings. It is noted that there is a practice of development in projects from the initial building permit drawings to the final construction, with final details like facade colors and materials often clarified in the detailed design phase. The municipality also addresses the issue of support walls in a separate letter under case BYGG-20/01238, pointing out specific concerns with regard to the planned construction on green areas.\n\n2022 at det kreves dispensasjon for \u00e5 etablere st\u00f8ttemurer innenfor regulert gr\u00f8nnstruktur og er negativ til \u00e5 innvilge dispensasjonss\u00f8knader som overskrider form\u00e5ls- eller byggegrenser. AT Arkitektur erkjenner at de burde ha s\u00f8kt om dispensasjon for st\u00f8ttemurene og ber om klarhet fra kommunen ang\u00e5ende hvilken sak og vurdering de skal forholde seg til, mens de ogs\u00e5 ber om en utsatt s\u00f8knadsfrist til andre forhold er avgjort. Klagerne anf\u00f8rer at de ikke har klagerett i henhold til forvaltningsloven og plan- og bygningsloven, og peker p\u00e5 at bygningene ikke er i samsvar med gitte tillatelser i bildene av godkjente bygninger.\n\nIn 2022, under case BYGG-20/01238, plans were submitted for a retaining wall along the property boundary to the west, with two walls potentially encroaching on green space. The municipality requires a dispensation for the walls to be built on green space and requests the application within 4 weeks. In a letter dated 23.11.2022 under case BYGG-22/01932, the municipality is against granting a dispensation for the retaining wall beyond the purpose boundary or building boundary towards the road, citing a negative opinion from Troms and Finnmark County. ATArkitektur acknowledges the need for a dispensation for the walls and seeks clarity on which case and evaluation the municipality is referring to for further action.\n\nThe document discusses the criteria for granting dispensations in legal cases, including the requirement for neighbors with legal standing to be able to lodge complaints. It determines that the complainants do not qualify as neighbors or adjacent property owners according to the building code definitions. Furthermore, it states that complaints made beyond one year after the decision was made cannot be considered, as per the legal statute cited.\n\nThe document refers to the annual report of the Parliamentary Ombudsman in 1985, specifically pointing out the limitation on the right to grant relief after the deadline for filing complaints has passed. It is emphasized that the deadline for seeking compensation for legal costs is absolute, even if proper notification has not been given. Therefore, appeals regarding matters already decided in planning decisions and building permits must be rejected according to the absolute one-year deadline specified in the regulations.\n\nThe document discusses the right to appeal administrative decisions, specifically in building cases, based on legal interest. It also addresses the absolute one-year time limit for filing complaints and the implications of previous decisions on new appeals. Overall, the document concludes that there is no basis for changing the decision, emphasizes the need for consistency in building regulations, and suggests specific measures to ensure predictability in future planning processes.Avinor received a wind and turbulence analysis report for a new hotel building in Troms\u00f8, dated August 4, 2020, and concluded that the proposed building meets safety criteria without exceeding limits. Additional steps are necessary before construction can begin, including approval for crane use and a lighting plan, which must be reviewed and approved by Avinor. The document is signed by Einar K Merli on November 30, 2020, from AT Plan & Arkitektur AS regarding the development of a new hotel building in Troms\u00f8.The document is dated 18.05.2020 and it is regarding a decision on a building permit for the construction of a hotel building at Huldervegen 2. The contact person is Espen Skov Pettersen with the phone number +47 948 57 302.

The applicants are advised to either submit a separate application for the support wall or wait for the dispensation request to be processed before proceeding with the building application.The document is a preliminary response to an application for a facade change of a hotel building. It requests further documentation and 3D illustrations of the facade in different lighting conditions. The document is dated May 12, 2023, and is addressed to HULDERVEGEN 2 AS.The document is a decision related to a building project in Troms\u00f8, dated 17.08.2020, granting temporary dispensation and starting authorization for foundation work for a hotel building. The dispensation is given for certain order requirements until the next application. The document outlines specific conditions that must be met before the next starting authorization, and also provides information on the appeal process and relevant contact information.On December 12, 2022, Berit Ballari sent a response with attachments to Anne-Marte T\u00f8gersen regarding Huldervegen 2, but encountered an issue with email due to the file size. To ensure the documents are received, Berit sent the response in one email and the attachments in another. Berit requested confirmation of receipt from Anne-Marte to ensure the documents were successfully delivered.The email dated March 6, 2022, discusses a hotel project in Huldervegen 2, Troms\u00f8, involving Avinor and the responsible applicant, Econor AS. The correspondence addresses two main issues: approval of building materials and facade design, and the need for Avinor to approve the lighting plan for both the construction phase and the completed building. Specific details about the materials, facade design, and lighting plans are provided with the aim of obtaining approval for the initiation of construction.Avinor filed a complaint on May 26, 2020 regarding the hotel building project at Huldervegen 2, outlining additional conditions for approval such as a flow analysis, approval for crane use, and a lighting plan. The responsible applicant responded to the complaint by stating that the project aligns with regulations and has initiated the required flow analysis. They also agreed to comply with the additional conditions set by Avinor to avoid further issues. The document was dated July 17, 2020 and was addressed to Troms\u00f8 municipality.This is a document from AT arkitektur dated 11.10.2023 regarding the approval of a hotel construction. The document confirms that all requirements and conditions have been met for the construction and outlines the different permits granted for the project.

A temporary dispensation is sought from regulation plan number 1788 to allow for construction to take place from 15.5.2023 to 1.7.2023, with the understanding that the developer will still fulfill their obligation to complete the infrastructure. The request for temporary extension is seen as reasonable due to the practical challenges posed by the northern climate and weather conditions.\n\nThe document discusses temporary solutions for sidewalks to ensure safety for pedestrians in the area from temporary use permits to the completion of infrastructure. The temporary waiver from regulatory plan provisions is not expected to significantly undermine the purpose behind the regulations, with measures to mitigate traffic issues outlined in a traffic analysis. The dispensation is not anticipated to significantly contravene the fundamental considerations that the planning and building law must uphold, with transparency and involvement from neighbors and local government discussed in the process.\n\nThe document discusses the assessment of whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of granting temporary dispensation for infrastructure development, dated but not provided.

The primary concern is to ensure that developers fulfill their obligations to develop public infrastructure as outlined in the regulatory plan.

It discusses delays in the completion of public infrastructure to be taken over by the municipality due to challenges in finalizing the project design before receiving comments and approval from the municipality. The total cost for the specified measures is calculated to be 70,546,875 NOK, with the developer paying 1,623,000 NOK as their share. The primary purpose of the regulation is to ensure that the developer fulfills their obligations to develop the public infrastructure outlined in the zoning plan.\n\nThe developer is committed to fulfilling obligations set out in the regulatory plan and development agreement with the municipality, including the construction of all public infrastructure outlined in the regulatory plan. Due to weather conditions in Troms\u00f8, it will not be possible to complete the infrastructure work before the planned handover of the hotel building on May 15, 2023. The request for temporary use permit is to allow for the completion of infrastructure work from May 15 to July 1, 2023, as delays have been caused by the lengthy processing time for technical plans by the municipality.\n\nIn 1788, provision VI letter h) states that before applying for temporary use permit, consideration must be made to ensure that the developer meets obligations to develop infrastructure. The temporary dispensation requested does not significantly disregard the purpose of the regulation, as the developer is still obligated to fulfill infrastructure requirements by July 1, 2023. Due to interim measures planned by SWECO, the safety of pedestrians in the area will be maintained until infrastructure completion.\n\nThe temporary dispensation will not significantly undermine the fundamental considerations the planning and building law should uphold, and it will not have direct consequences for the environment and society. It is emphasized that transparency and participation have been ensured in the process by notifying neighbors of the dispensation issue. Despite potential delays in public infrastructure completion, the benefits of granting the temporary dispensation, such as safety measures and timely use of the hotel building, outweigh the drawbacks according to the planning and building law.\n\nThe temporary dispensation from regulation plan provision VI letter h) is considered to be fulfilled, as per the Planning and Building Act \u00a7 19-2.
