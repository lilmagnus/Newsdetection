"Magnus Wilhelmsen is inquiring about when he can expect his plot boundaries to be measured at Skjelnansvingen 78, as he plans to build a fence this year. He mentions that several others in the area also need measurements and wonders if it could be done all at once. He believes that the service should be free in his case."
