"The email from \u00d8ystein Larssen on September 1, 2023, addresses unstarted construction work due to the need to remove a support wall facing imminent collapse, deemed exempt from permit requirements under emergency circumstances. The work has been completed after consulting with the project owner, showing the need for a permit due to encroachment on adjacent property. The situation may be remedied by moving the slope's foundation or installing a support wall to meet regulations.The document is a decision dated September 1, 2023, ordering Tor Vangberg to immediately halt ongoing terrain changes on his property in Troms\u00f8. The municipality found that the work was being done without the necessary permits and was too close to property boundaries, requiring a dispensation. Failure to comply may result in police assistance, possible legal action, or imposition of a penalty of 50,000 kr for non-compliance."
