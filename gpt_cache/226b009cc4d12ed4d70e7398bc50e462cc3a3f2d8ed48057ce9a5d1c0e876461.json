It also evaluates building restrictions for flight navigation systems at the airport, with a radio technical analysis showing that the hotel building will not negatively affect the systems. There are concerns about using a tower crane for construction due to potential radio technical issues, with the recommendation that crane use be properly assessed and possibly tested at the expense of the developer.\n\nThe document, dated 02.05.2019, addresses the need for a lighting plan for buildings and outdoor areas near Troms\u00f8 Airport to ensure aviation safety.
