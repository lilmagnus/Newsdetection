"An application for a pre-negotiation conference has been made by ASTACO, the property owner of Heilovegen 23 in Troms\u00f8. The purpose is to seek approval for a new application to convert the building into housing units for Ukrainian refugees. The proposed changes in the new application include adjustments to meet updated regulations and technical requirements. The application also requests dispensation from parking requirements and order requirements in the current zoning plan. The conference is scheduled for December 5th, with representatives from ASTACO, AT architecture, and the municipality in attendance.The email exchange is regarding a planned pre-conference conference regarding property 117/53 at Heilovegen 23, Scandic hotel. The meeting had to be postponed due to lack of necessary clarifications from other sections of the municipality. The sender, Bettina Elise Haug, mentions that they are waiting for feedback from other sections and will reschedule the meeting soon. The email also emphasizes that during a pre-conference conference, only guidance on regulations can be provided, and decisions on exceptions or dispensations will be made after feedback from other sections.The address of the meeting is R\u00e5dhusgata 2, 9008 Troms\u00f8. The meeting is about a proposed change from a hotel to residential use at Heilovegen 23. The meeting attendees include representatives from AT ARKITEKTUR AS, AS TACO, and Troms\u00f8 kommune. Questions about technical requirements for housing and parking regulations are discussed, as well as the possibility of housing Ukrainian refugees. The meeting also addresses deviations from building regulations and the need for internal clarification within the municipality. The property is covered by two zoning plans.\n\nNyere planer har vanligvis forrang for eldre planer, med mindre noe annet er angitt i planbestemmelsene. En omr\u00e5dereguleringsplan vedtatt etter 2006 g\u00e5r foran en kommuneplan fra 2017 ved motstrid. For bygging og anlegg, er det krav om en plan for renhold og st\u00f8vdemping under bygge- og anleggsperioden. En omr\u00e5dereguleringsplan krever plan for ny bebyggelse og anlegg, men ikke for bruksendring. For en foresl\u00e5tt bruksendring fra hotell til boliger, m\u00e5 det gis tilstrekkelig dokumentasjon i bygges\u00f8knaden som dekker kravene i en reguleringsplan. Kommunen gir muligheten for avvik fra tekniske krav og parkeringskrav, men krever en grundig begrunnelse i s\u00f8knaden. Det anbefales \u00e5 vurdere en midlertidig forskrift for \u00e5 huse flyktninger fra Ukraina som melloml\u00f8sning, inntil planene for eiendommen og bygget er avgjort. Kommunen gir ogs\u00e5 anbefalinger ang\u00e5ende universell utforming og heis med b\u00e5remulighet. Gebyr for forh\u00e5ndskonferansen vil bli fakturert til tiltakshaver.A response email discussing a meeting regarding the \"old Scandic\" building, with various participants being confirmed to attend.
