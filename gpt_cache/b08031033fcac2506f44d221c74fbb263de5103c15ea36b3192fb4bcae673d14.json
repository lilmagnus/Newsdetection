"The email pertains to a complaint from Avinor regarding the construction of a hotel building in Huldervegen 2. The email contains attachments with information related to the complaint and a response to it. The date of the email is Friday, July 17, 2020.The email exchange is regarding a building project in Troms\u00f8 municipality, specifically Huldervegen 2, related to the flight path guidelines. Avinor requests updated documentation for the project in relation to regulations and radio technical assessments before they can proceed with their assessment. The correspondence spans from February 2019 to June 2020, with Torstein Piltingsrud from ATPA seeking feedback and approval for the project from Avinor.The document dated 26.05.2020 from Avinor addresses a complaint from Troms\u00f8 municipality regarding the construction of a hotel building near Troms\u00f8 airport. The planned building will not interfere with the height restriction zones around the airport, as it will be within the specified limits. There was a previous request to have a crane on the east side of the hotel building, which may need further discussion.\n\nThe document dated May 2, 2019 outlines the procedures for the use of tower cranes and mobile cranes in relation to aviation safety at airports. The developer must conduct a risk analysis according to recognized standards and submit it to Avinor for approval by Luftfartstilsynet. For mobile cranes, approval must be sought from Troms\u00f8 airport in advance, and the developer is responsible for implementing necessary procedures for communication with the control tower.\n\nThe document discusses regulations for reporting and registering aviation obstacles related to the use of cranes, with a reference to luftfartstilsynet.no. A radiotechnical analysis conducted on a hotel building near Troms\u00f8 airport on June 3, 2019, concluded that it would not adversely affect the airport's navigation systems. Concerns were raised about the use of tower cranes for construction and the need for radiotechnical assessments, possibly requiring test flights at the developer's expense.\n\nPlans for lighting and obstruction height at Troms\u00f8 airport must be approved by Avinor to ensure aviation safety. The minimum height for aircraft during landing in poor visibility conditions is specified, with requirements for visibility of the runway and approach lights. Any planned structures near the runway must adhere to height restrictions to avoid turbulence impacts on aircraft operations, as per EASA regulations.\n\nAvinor has raised concerns about a significant exceedance of the height/length ratio for the project, particularly during the final approach to runway 01. They have requested the developer to conduct a flow analysis/turbulence analysis from a reputable provider. Avinor has formally requested the inclusion of specific requirements related to flow analysis, crane operation approval, and lighting plans in the building permit for a hotel in Huldervegen 2, and will escalate the issue to the County Governor if these points are not addressed.\n\n- The document, dated June 6, 2019, outlines Avinor's concerns regarding the construction of a new hotel near Troms\u00f8 Airport, citing potential turbulence risks due to the building's proximity to the airport.\n- Avinor emphasizes the importance of conducting a flow analysis (turbulence analysis) for the planned hotel to ensure it does not create turbulence that could impact airport operations.\n- The document requests that Troms\u00f8 Municipality, as the building authority, include a turbulence analysis requirement in the building permit for the hotel construction project.The document sent on June 17, 2020, discusses the requirement for conducting a flow analysis for a new hotel construction in Troms\u00f8. Avinor emphasizes the necessity of ensuring no turbulence is caused by the hotel near the airport. They stress the importance of complying with European regulations to avoid any disruptions to airport operations.Avinor has filed a conditional complaint regarding the construction of a hotel building, outlining specific additional requirements related to flow analysis, crane usage approval, and lighting plan approval. The responsible applicant is complying with Avinor's requirements, with flow analysis already underway and plans to address crane usage and lighting. The applicant accepts Avinor's input as documentation requirements to ensure smooth approval processes."
