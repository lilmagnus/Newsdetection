"The document dated 09.01.2023 details a public review of a plan for the development of Kr\u00e6mer Brygge in Troms\u00f8, proposed by Kr\u00e6mer eiendom AS and prepared by Asplan Viak AS. The plan aims to create an urban area with new buildings and a canal, following the guidelines set by the proposal for changing KDP 0253 Stakkevollveien byutviklingsomr\u00e5de. State Road Administration (Statens vegvesen) provided feedback on the plan, supporting the increase in housing and urban development but raising concerns about certain aspects of the plan, particularly in relation to traffic management and infrastructure development.This document, dated 18.11.2020, relates to the start of the detailed regulation of Kr\u00e6mer Brygge Nord\u00f8st in Troms\u00f8. The Sami Parliament has no special comments on the regulation, but warns that any discovery of older artifacts during fieldwork must be reported immediately. The document emphasizes the protection of Sami cultural heritage sites and the prohibition of damaging or altering them.The email dated Fri, 27 Oct 2023, contains revised planning documents for Kr\u00e6mer Brygge Nord\u00f8st, including updated OSG and ROS analysis. The division of new common areas into three sections is explained to clarify responsibility and tailor the use of outdoor spaces for each building. Sigrid Rasmussen from Asplan Viak requests confirmation of receipt and updates on the progress of the case from Johanne Kryger at Troms\u00f8 Kommune.The document dated June 7, 2023, is a geotechnical assessment responding to comments from NVE regarding the development of residential buildings. The area near Kr\u00e6mer has soft clay layers, pockets of quick clay, and a history of ground collapses. The document addresses these geotechnical challenges in relation to the planned development.\n\nThe document, dated 711607-RIG-NOT-015, discusses two ground failures caused by local (rotational) slides, with no expansion into previous filled areas. The ground failures were attributed to rapid or excessive filling, despite the material classifying as brittle failure. Suggestions include no establishment of a danger zone, but implementing Class 3 measures for extended geotechnical project control, in relation to building residential blocks.\n\nKr\u00e6mer Eiendom has started detailed planning of Alfan DEF, with the plan being subject to public consultation. NVE has commented on the consultation, requesting confirmation from Multiconsult that the location and properties of the material make it unnecessary to investigate a quick clay zone according to NVE 1/2019 in connection with the zoning plan. The ground conditions in the area, while classified as quick clay material, have not exhibited typical quick clay behavior, with recommendations for extended geotechnical design control but no establishment of a danger zone.\n\nDet anbefales at kvalitetssikringen av et notat utf\u00f8res av et uavhengig foretak iht krav for tiltakskategori K4. NVE mener det ikke er n\u00f8dvendig \u00e5 utf\u00f8re kvalitetssikringen av et uavhengig foretak, da spr\u00f8bruddmaterialet i sj\u00f8en ikke ber\u00f8rer et stort omr\u00e5de p\u00e5 land.

The seabed is lower than in 2019, indicating the original masses have shifted further down. For more details on ground conditions, refer to reports numbered 711607-RIG-RAP-003 and 711607-RIG-RAP-007.\n\nThe document 711607-RIG-NOT-015 from June 7, 2023, discusses ground surveys conducted after a ground collapse north of Essokaia. Filling activities and previous assessments from the 1970s and 1980s near residential blocks Alfon A and C are described. The document details a local ground collapse observed in December 2021 after additional filling activities were carried out and theorizes that it may have been caused by these activities.\n\nThe document discusses ground failures labeled as \"landslide brink slide no. 2\" on drawing -925, which involved original masses from the seabed and reduced slope stability. A recommended solution was the installation of a pipe wall to secure slope stability, done in the winter of 2022/2023, with future expansion plans to establish new fillings. The area where the pipe wall was installed is secure, while the section between Alfon A and C may require a similar solution in the future to prevent ground failures.\n\nThe document, dated in 2021, discusses two ground breaks on a plot of land, both being local rotation landslides. The filling activities near the residential buildings Alfan A and C have been ongoing since the 1970s, with sporadic storage of materials in certain areas since the 1970/80s. A ground break occurred in 2019 during filling activities beyond the projected limit, causing damage to the newly filled area and part of the Esso dock, with subsequent underwater ground breaks in 2021 during further filling efforts.\n\nThe document discusses the possibility of a foundation failure at Essokaia due to the demolition process, with a focus on slide edge no. 2. It mentions the reduction in slope stability and recommends against adding new backfill due to the presence of clay layers. A pipe wall was suggested as a temporary solution to ensure stability during the construction of residential buildings, with the need for immediate maintenance if a failure occurs. The site's soft clay layers make it prone to ground failures, and precautions are advised during construction to prevent further incidents.\n\nOver the past 40 years, there have been more than 20 ground breaches related to landfills in the area, including two at the specific site mentioned in the document. These breaches have been localized and caused by rapid or improper filling procedures. Despite being classified as brittle material, the ground breaches have not exhibited typical brittle behavior.\n\nThe document is from 2013 and describes the composition and properties of sediments at different depths from two boreholes. The sediments consist mainly of silty and sandy clay with coral and shell fragments, with water content varying between 42.5% and 60.1%.
