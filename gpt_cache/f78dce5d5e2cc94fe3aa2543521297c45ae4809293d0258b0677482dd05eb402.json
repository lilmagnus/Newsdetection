"Kamilla Nylund and Andr\u00e9 Bruvold are inquiring about building an extension on the north side of their building, which will be 13.86 square meters in area and two stories high. They are seeking clarification on whether or not they need to apply for a permit for this project, particularly due to the height of 6.4 meters. They are also asking if they can apply for the permit themselves or if they need to hire a licensed company to do so.The email is a query about whether a proposed construction project is exempt from requiring a building permit. The sender references building regulations stating that extensions with a certain size and number of stories are exempt from permit requirements. They attach an illustration of the proposed extension for clarification.Andr\u00e9 Luca Westerlund Bruvold inquired about the need for a building permit to construct an addition to his property at Morildvegen 51 in Troms\u00f8.
